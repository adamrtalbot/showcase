### 2. Navigate into the seqeralabs/showcase Workspace

All resources in Seqera Platform live inside a Workspace, which in turn belong to an Organisation. Typically, teams of colleagues or collaborators will share one or more workspaces. All resources in a Workspace (i.e. pipelines, compute environments, datasets) are shared by members of that workspace.

Navigate into the `seqeralabs/showcase` Workspace.
